1. main.ipynb contains the code for the Eigenfaces Face recognition algorithm.
2. Report.pdf contains the report for understanding the implementation of the code in main.ipynb
3. dataset consist of train and test folders. Each containing the train and test dataset for training and checking the algorithm. 
4. Further in the code implementation the train dataset has been splitted into 7:3 such that out of the 10 images 7 will go to the train set and 3 will go to the test 2 set.
5. To run the code simply run all the cells in the notebook.
6. If you want to train the model on your personal dataset. You can do so by changing the faces_dir variable and set it to the path of the new dataset..
